![](dissimilarity-mat.jpg "Distance matrix in terms of frame energy difference. There are 148 frames in the sample video. Thus, the distance matrix is indexed by 1-148 at both dimension. It is smmetric and the diagonal is supposed to be all 0. Locally adjacent frames normally are similar and thus there exist dark blocks close to the diagonal.")
